A ‘typed signature’ is a digital signature created using third-party vendor signature verification software, such as DocuSign or Adobe Sign, that displays an individual’s name typed out in a computer-generated font. If a typed signature can be accepted, it will be specified on Panorama forms in the ‘Use this form to’ section. Forms with a typed signature must be provided to us by a primary email address or uploaded via the Panorama ‘Forms & requests’ page, as we cannot accept typed signatures by post. These forms must also be accompanied by the third-party vendor software digital signature certificate.

It’s important to complete the Choice of super fund form and give it to your employer as soon as possible, so that they are using the new USI.

At the very latest, they need to be using the new USI from 1 April 2024.

If your employer is not using the new USI from April 2024, your super contributions may not be paid to your account. If this were to happen, the contributions would need to be re-submitted using the new USI. To download our 'Choice of super fund' form, which includes our complying fund statement:
1. Select 'Go to page'.
2. In the 'Deposits and contributions' section, select 'Choice of super fund' then follow the prompts.
```

**Actual Buttons**: "Go to page", "USI & ABN"
