We are contacting clients who are still receiving contributions under the old USI. Clients need to give the form, which includes the new USI, to their employer.

We are working to a 1 April 2024 deadline. Up until then, we will monitor clients
whose contributions are being paid under the old USI and will periodically issue reminder notices, which we will include you in.

If by 1 April 2024 a client has not provided the form to their employer, and the employer is not using the new USI, super contributions may cease to be credited to the client’s account. If this were to happen, the contributions would need to be re-submitted using the new USI. To download our 'Choice of super fund' form, which includes our complying fund statement, select ‘Show me how’.
