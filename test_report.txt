Use of segments:

Segment Overlap:
Segments are not structured to be unique, most of the time multiple segments are matched on the same metadata

Segment linking to disabled intents:
Segmented responses offering quick replies, buttons etc to intents disabled for the segments

Live agent escalation
220+ instances throughout the flow, self service opportunities?

NLU Model
Needs a proper cleanup, evidenced by the 69% F1, despite this NLU performance on 5.8 better than 3.2 

1. Response Content Issues

  - Missing responses ("N/A")
  - Disabled intent messages
  - Inactive intent messages
  - Missing intent data files

  2. Missing Data

  - No example triggers
  - No valid trigger sentences
  - Missing intent/response definitions

  3. Disabled/Inactive Status

  - Intents marked as inactive
  - Segments marked as inactive
  - Intents in segment's disabled_actions list
  - Explicit IntentMessageDisabled files

  4. Segment-Intent Incompatibility

  - Pension accounts can't use deposit_funds
  - Public/unauthenticated segments can't access secure functions
  - Investment accounts can't use super-specific features

  5. Test Type Specific Rules

  - Conversation flows: missing clarification responses or rules
  - Navigation tests: excluded patterns (feedback, survey, ratings)
  - Missing quick replies or navigation targets
