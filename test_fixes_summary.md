# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Conversation Flow Test Response Content
- **Issue**: Expected response showed response document names (e.g., "bt_request_for_withdrawal_partial_withdrawal_response") instead of actual text content
- **Fix**: Modified `conversation_flow_test_generator.py` and `consolidated_test_generator.py` to extract and use actual response text content
- **Result**: Conversation flow tests now show proper expected response text

### 2. Global Segment Validation
- **Issue**: Tests were being generated for intents disabled in the global segment, which always fail
- **Fix**: Implemented global segment validation rule that checks `segments/global.json` disabled_actions array
- **Result**: 192 tests filtered out (8 globally disabled intents × 24 segments), reducing invalid tests

### 3. Intent Navigation Test Response Content
- **Issue**: Expected response showed response document names (e.g., "bt_login_failure_response") instead of actual text content
- **Fix**: Modified `intent_navigation_test_generator.py` and `consolidated_test_generator.py` to extract and use actual response text content for both turns
- **Result**: Intent navigation tests now show proper expected response text

## Test Results After Fixes

### Overall Impact
- **Previous filtered subset**: 53 tests
- **New filtered subset**: 42 tests (11 bt_request_for_withdrawal tests removed)
- **Success rate**: 73.8% (31/42 tests passing)

### Remaining Issues

#### Intent Mismatches (3)
1. **bt_tax_and_annual_statements** → bt_change_name (trigger: "#NAME?")
2. **bt_funds_not_received** → bt_employer_contribution_details

These appear to be NLU issues where the triggers are being misclassified.

#### Failed Intent Navigation Tests (8)
All failed tests are intent navigation tests expecting to navigate to bt_login_failure:
- Actions_Menu → "Help me sign in" → bt_login_failure
- bt_term_deposit → "Help logging in" → bt_login_failure  
- bt_register → "Help me sign in" → bt_login_failure
- bt_view_closed_accounts → "Help me sign in" → bt_login_failure
- bt_wrap_employer_cont → "ABN & USI" → bt_usi_abn
- bt_how_logout → "Help me sign in" → bt_login_failure
- bt_approval_notify → "Help me sign in" → bt_login_failure
- bt_tax_and_annual_statements → "Why does my client have two statements" → bt_platforms_sft

**Root Cause**: The bot is not navigating to the expected intents when buttons are clicked in the public/unauthenticated context. Instead, it provides generic authentication prompts.

## Summary

The fixes successfully addressed:
1. ✅ Response content display issues (showing names instead of text)
2. ✅ Global segment validation (filtering out system-wide disabled intents)
3. ✅ Improved test reliability by removing tests that would always fail

The remaining failures (8 intent navigation tests) appear to be due to actual bot behavior differences in how navigation works in different channel contexts, rather than test generation issues.
